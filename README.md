Python REST API built with the Flask framework, that works to keep track of product items - by keeping record of them
via SQLAlchemy and storing information pertaining to the item names, descriptions, prices and quantities. The program is
a full-on CRUD API (Creates Data [GET], Reads Data [POST], Updates Data [PUT] and Deletes Data [DELETE]).

Technology used for this project: Atom text editor, Flask framework, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Marshmallow, and 
Postman for testing.
